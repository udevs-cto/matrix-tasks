**Task: Evaluate Database Design and Normalization in a Library Management System**

**Scenario:** You are tasked with designing a database schema for a Library Management System (LMS). This task will assess your ability to create a database that effectively models a complex system and your skill in applying normalization techniques to ensure data integrity.

**Requirements:**

1. **Database Design:** Design a database schema for a Library Management System. Consider the entities, relationships, and attributes relevant to an LMS. Entities may include books, library members, library staff, borrowings, and more. Create a logical structure with tables, relationships, and attributes.

2. **Normalization:** Apply normalization techniques to the database schema you've designed. Ensure that it conforms to the principles of normalization, including minimizing redundancy, ensuring data integrity, and adhering to normalization forms (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF).

3. **Justification:** Provide a clear and well-reasoned justification for your design and normalization choices. Explain how your schema aligns with the requirements of a Library Management System and why you selected specific normalization forms.

4. **Implementation:** If you choose, you can create a sample database schema using a database design tool (e.g., ERD diagram) to visually represent your design.

5. **Documentation:** Document your database schema and normalization process clearly and comprehensively. Include detailed explanations of your design decisions, any changes made during normalization, and the resulting schema. Ensure that the documentation is organized and easy to follow.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. A logical and comprehensive database schema that effectively models a Library Management System, including tables, relationships, and attributes.

2. Effective application of normalization techniques to ensure data integrity, minimize redundancy, and adhere to normalization forms.

3. Well-justified design and normalization decisions, with explanations that align with the LMS requirements.

4. Precision in the implementation, if provided.

5. Clarity, completeness, and organization of the documentation, demonstrating your expertise in database design and normalization for an LMS.

This task will evaluate your proficiency in designing a database schema for a Library Management System and applying normalization techniques to maintain data integrity and efficiency. It will assess your ability to create a structured, well-justified schema and document your design and normalization choices effectively.
