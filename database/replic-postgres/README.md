**Task: Set Up a Master-Slave Replication for PostgreSQL Server**

**Scenario:** In this task, you will be responsible for configuring a PostgreSQL database system with a master-slave replication setup. Master-slave replication is a common database architecture that allows for data redundancy, load distribution, and high availability. This task will evaluate your ability to establish such a setup effectively.

**Requirements:**

1. **Server Environment:**
   - Ensure that you have two separate servers or virtual machines running PostgreSQL. One will serve as the master, and the other as the slave.

2. **Installation and Configuration:**
   - Install PostgreSQL on both the master and slave servers if not already installed.
   - Configure the PostgreSQL instances with appropriate settings to ensure compatibility.

3. **Data Backup:**
   - Create a backup of the master database to be used for the initial data transfer to the slave.

4. **Replication Configuration:**
   - Set up replication configurations on the master server to allow the slave to connect and replicate data.
   - Configure parameters like `wal_level`, `max_wal_senders`, `wal_keep_segments`, etc., as required for streaming replication.

5. **Initial Data Transfer:**
   - Transfer the data from the master server to the slave using an appropriate method (e.g., `pg_basebackup`, `pg_dump`, etc.).

6. **Testing:**
   - Ensure that the replication is functioning as expected. Test data changes on the master to confirm that they are replicated to the slave.

7. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring tools or scripts to keep an eye on the replication status, lag, and any potential issues.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation of the entire setup, including configurations, data transfer methods, and monitoring procedures. This documentation should be clear and organized for reference.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Successful establishment of a master-slave replication setup.

2. Accuracy in configuring PostgreSQL replication parameters.

3. Proper data transfer from master to slave.

4. Effective monitoring of the replication process.

5. Comprehensive and organized documentation.

**Note:** Ensure that the two servers have network connectivity and are appropriately secured. This task focuses on the setup and configuration aspects of PostgreSQL master-slave replication.
