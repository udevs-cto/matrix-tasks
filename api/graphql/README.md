**Task: Implement GraphQL in a Monolithic Library Management System**

**Scenario:** In this task, you will evaluate a candidate's knowledge of GraphQL by asking them to implement GraphQL in an existing monolithic Library Management System (LMS) application. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST for data retrieval. This task assesses the candidate's ability to integrate GraphQL into an existing application.

**Requirements:**

1. **Library Management System (LMS):**
   - Assume that there is an existing monolithic Library Management System (LMS) application. It should have features such as managing books, users, borrowing books, and returning books.

2. **GraphQL Implementation:**
   - Instruct the candidate to integrate GraphQL into the LMS application.

3. **GraphQL Schema:**
   - Ask the candidate to define a GraphQL schema that includes types for books, users, borrowing, and returning books. The schema should define queries and mutations to interact with these types.

4. **Queries and Mutations:**
   - Request the candidate to create GraphQL queries and mutations for the following actions:
     a. Query to fetch a list of books in the library.
     b. Query to fetch details of a specific book by its ID.
     c. Mutation to give a book to student, requiring student ID and book ID.
     d. Mutation to return a book from student, requiring student ID and book ID.

5. **Authorization:**
   - Ensure that the candidate implements proper authorization and authentication mechanisms for GraphQL. There should be only one admin user type and it can perform all the actions.

6. **Testing:**
   - Instruct the candidate to write test cases to validate the GraphQL queries and mutations, ensuring the system behaves as expected.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Successful integration of GraphQL into the monolithic Library Management System.

2. Proper definition of a GraphQL schema with relevant types, queries, and mutations.

3. Effective implementation of GraphQL queries and mutations for book management.

4. Implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms.

5. Creation of test cases to validate GraphQL functionality.

This task assesses the candidate's ability to integrate GraphQL into an existing monolithic application, define a schema, and create queries and mutations to interact with data. It also evaluates their understanding of authentication and authorization in GraphQL.
