**Task: Create a Function to Generate Unique IDs Starting with Specific Characters**

**Scenario:** In this task, you will develop a function that generates unique IDs. These IDs should start with specific characters or a character pattern defined by the user. The function will be valuable for creating custom identifiers in various applications.

**Requirements:**

1. **Function Design:**
   - Create a function that generates unique IDs. The function should accept parameters to specify the starting characters or pattern and other relevant configuration options.

2. **Starting Characters:**
   - Allow users to define the characters or character pattern that the generated IDs should start with. For example, users might specify "ABC" to indicate that the ID should start with "ABC."

3. **Unique IDs:**
   - Ensure that the generated IDs are unique within the context they are used. Duplication of IDs should be prevented.

4. **Configuration Options:**
   - Provide options to configure the length of the ID, the character set that can be used, and any other relevant settings.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to address scenarios where the specified pattern or character set is invalid, or if there are constraints that might affect the uniqueness of IDs.

6. **Testing:**
   - Create tests to verify the uniqueness and correctness of generated IDs, especially when using different character patterns or configurations.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Successful development of a function that generates unique IDs with user-defined starting characters or patterns.

2. Proper handling of user-defined character patterns and configuration options.

3. Ensuring the uniqueness of generated IDs within the context they are used.

4. Effective error handling and validation of user input.

5. Comprehensive testing to verify the functionality of the ID generation function.

This task assesses your ability to design and implement a function that generates unique IDs with specific starting characters or patterns. It evaluates your skills in handling user input, ensuring uniqueness, and effective error handling.
