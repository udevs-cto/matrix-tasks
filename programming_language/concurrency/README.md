**Task: Create a Concurrent Programming Example in C/C++**

**Scenario:** In this task, you will be creating a concurrent program in C/C++ to demonstrate your knowledge of concurrent programming concepts, including multithreading, synchronization, and communication between threads.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a C/C++ program that utilizes multithreading to perform a concurrent task. The task should be computationally intensive, allowing for concurrent execution.

2. Implement at least two threads within your program, each responsible for a specific part of the task.

3. Use synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes or semaphores, to manage concurrent access to shared resources or critical sections of the code.

4. Design a communication mechanism between the threads, such as passing data or signaling between them.

5. Ensure that the program correctly utilizes concurrent programming concepts and that it produces the expected result.

6. Provide comments and documentation explaining your design choices, the purpose of each thread, the use of synchronization mechanisms, and how communication between threads is achieved.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Effective use of multithreading to perform a concurrent task.

2. Proper application of synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.

3. Successful implementation of communication between threads.

4. Correctness and efficiency of the program.

5. Clarity in the design and documentation of your concurrent program.

This task allows you to demonstrate your proficiency in creating concurrent programs in C/C++, showcasing your understanding of multithreading, synchronization, and communication between threads. It also assesses your ability to design and document concurrent code effectively.
