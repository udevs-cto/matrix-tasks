**Task: Design an Object-Oriented Program for Geometric Shapes**

**Scenario:** You are tasked with designing an object-oriented program to model different geometric shapes. The program should demonstrate your understanding of key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a base class called `Shape` that includes common attributes and methods for all geometric shapes. Some common attributes could include color, position, and area.

2. Implement three or more derived classes (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) that inherit from the `Shape` class. Each derived class should represent a specific geometric shape and include attributes and methods relevant to that shape.

3. For each derived class, implement methods to calculate the area and perimeter (if applicable) of that shape.

4. Ensure that the `Shape` class has an abstract method `calculateArea` (and optionally `calculatePerimeter`) that must be implemented by each derived class.

5. Create a program that demonstrates the functionality of your shape classes. Instantiate different shape objects, set their attributes, and calculate and display their areas and perimeters.

6. Utilize polymorphism by creating an array or collection of `Shape` objects and demonstrate calling the `calculateArea` (and optionally `calculatePerimeter`) method on each shape without knowing the specific derived class.

7. Provide clear and concise comments and documentation explaining your design choices and the functionality of your program.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Effective application of OOP principles, including inheritance and polymorphism.

2. Logical design of classes and relationships between objects.

3. Proper implementation of abstract methods in derived classes.

4. Successful demonstration of polymorphism by working with shape objects through the base class.

5. Clarity in the design and documentation of your program.

This task allows you to assess the individual's understanding of OOP concepts, such as inheritance and polymorphism, in the context of modeling geometric shapes. It also evaluates their ability to design a class hierarchy, implement abstract methods, and write well-documented code.
