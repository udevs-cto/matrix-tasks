# Task: Create an HTTP API Endpoint in C++

Scenario: You are tasked with building a basic HTTP server in C++ that serves as an API for a simple web application. 
The server should be capable of handling HTTP GET requests and responding with appropriate JSON data.

## Requirements:
1. Implement an HTTP server in C++ using a library or framework of your choice (e.g., Boost.Asio, Pistache, or others).
2. Create at least one API endpoint that responds to HTTP GET requests. The endpoint should provide a simple JSON response.
3. Define a route for the API endpoint (e.g., /api/resource) and specify the expected behavior.
4. The API endpoint should handle requests and return JSON data containing dummy information, such as a message or key-value pairs.
5. Demonstrate proper error handling for cases such as invalid routes or unsupported HTTP methods.
6. Provide clear and concise instructions for building and running the server, including any required dependencies.

## Evaluation Criteria:
1. Successful implementation of an HTTP server in C++ that can handle HTTP GET requests.
2. Implementation of at least one API endpoint with a defined route and the ability to return JSON responses.
3. Proper error handling and response status codes for different scenarios.
4. Clean and well-organized code with appropriate comments and documentation.
5. Clarity in the instructions for building and running the server.
6. By assigning this task, you can assess the individual's ability to create a basic HTTP server in C++ and 
their understanding of routing, handling HTTP requests, and generating JSON responses. Additionally, 
you can evaluate the quality and maintainability of their code.
