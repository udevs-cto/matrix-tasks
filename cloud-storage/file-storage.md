**Task: Create a RESTful File System API for Uploading and Retrieving Files**

**Scenario:** In this task, you will be assessed on your ability to design and implement a RESTful API that allows users to upload and retrieve files from a server. A file system API is a valuable feature for various applications, from document management to media storage.

**Requirements:**

1. **API Design:**
   - Create a RESTful API with two endpoints: one for uploading files to the server and another for retrieving files.
   - Define the API routes, request methods, and any required request parameters (e.g., file upload, file name, user authentication).

2. **File Upload:**
   - Implement an endpoint that allows users to upload files to the server. Users should be able to upload files of varying sizes.

3. **File Storage:** Store the uploaded files on the server, ensuring they are organized and easily retrievable.

4. **File Retrieval:**
   - Create an endpoint that allows users to retrieve files from the server. Users should be able to specify the file they want to access.

5. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication or authorization mechanisms to secure the API. Users should be authenticated before they can upload or retrieve files.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling in your API to gracefully manage issues like failed file uploads, unauthorized access, and invalid requests.

7. **Response Handling:**
   - Return appropriate responses, such as success messages, file links, or error codes, to users after file uploads or retrievals.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Create clear and comprehensive documentation for your API, including details on how to make requests, required headers or parameters, and example responses.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Successful implementation of RESTful API endpoints for uploading and retrieving files.

2. Proper user authentication to ensure secure file operations.

3. Effective file storage and organization on the server.

4. Robust error handling to manage various scenarios.

5. Clear and well-documented APIs for usage.

This task assesses your ability to design and implement a RESTful API for file upload and retrieval. It evaluates your skills in API design, user authentication, error handling, and effective file storage and retrieval.
