**Task: Implement API for Uploading Image and Large Files to Amazon S3**

**Scenario:** In this task, you will demonstrate your ability to create APIs for uploading images and large files to Amazon S3, a popular cloud storage service. Amazon S3 is widely used for storing and managing data, and creating APIs to upload files to S3 is a valuable skill for web developers.

**Requirements:**

1. **AWS Account Setup:** Ensure you have an AWS account and access credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) that provide permissions to interact with Amazon S3.

2. **API Design:**
   - Create two separate API endpoints: one for uploading images and another for uploading large files (e.g., documents, videos).
   - Define the API routes and request parameters (e.g., file, user authentication).

3. **Authentication:** Implement user authentication for the APIs. Users should be authenticated before they can upload files to Amazon S3.

4. **File Upload:** Design the APIs to accept files as part of the HTTP request. Users should be able to upload files of varying sizes.

5. **Amazon S3 Integration:**
   - Integrate your APIs with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDK or library. Use the provided AWS access credentials for authentication.
   - Define the appropriate S3 bucket(s) where uploaded files will be stored.

6. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling in your APIs to gracefully manage issues like failed uploads, authentication failures, and invalid requests.

7. **Response Handling:** Return appropriate responses, such as success messages or error codes, to the users after file uploads.

8. **Documentation:** Create clear and concise documentation for your APIs, including details on how to make requests, required headers or parameters, and example responses.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Successful implementation of API endpoints for uploading images and large files to Amazon S3.

2. Proper user authentication to ensure secure uploads.

3. Effective integration with Amazon S3 for file storage.

4. Robust error handling to manage various scenarios.

5. Clear and well-documented APIs for usage.

This task evaluates your ability to create APIs for uploading files to Amazon S3, a widely used cloud storage service. It assesses your skills in API design, user authentication, error handling, and integration with Amazon S3.
